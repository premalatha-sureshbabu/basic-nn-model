# Developing a Neural Network Regression Model

## AIM

To develop a neural network regression model for the given dataset.

## THEORY

To build a neural network regression model for predicting a continuous target variable, we will follow a systematic approach. The process includes loading and pre-processing the dataset by addressing missing data, scaling the features, and ensuring proper input-output mapping. Then, a neural network model will be constructed, incorporating multiple layers designed to capture intricate patterns within the dataset. We will train this model, monitoring performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE), to ensure accurate predictions. After training, the model will be validated and tested on unseen data to confirm its generalization ability. The final objective is to derive actionable insights from the data, helping to improve decision-making and better understand the dynamics of the target variable. Additionally, the model will be fine-tuned to enhance performance, and hyperparameter optimization will be carried out to further improve predictive accuracy. The resulting model is expected to provide a robust framework for making precise predictions and facilitating in-depth data analysis.
